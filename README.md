# vginsights_DS_project3
This project aims to create an ETL pipeline in order to load data (about 1GB) of video games with their statistics and their history performances.
We segmented and merged csv and json files into multiple tables and then brought everything back together in a clean, organized database using MYSQL and Pandas.
